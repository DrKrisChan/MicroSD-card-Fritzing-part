# MicroSD-card-shield-Fritzing-part
MicroSD card shield Fritzing part. This is a modification of the original cheap MicroSD card shield part designed by Peter Van Epp (vanepp in forums), except from the reverse side (which typically is the top due to the presoldered header pins).


#### Image example (made on Fritzing):

### How to add part:
Open Fritzing then locate the new part under File > Open > 'Micro SD card reader (writing top).fzpz' The part will then be added to your parts list (under MINE folder) or you can search for it as "Micro SD card reader (writing top)"
